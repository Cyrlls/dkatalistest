Here is the Script that is used to answer number 1 and number 2 task that ask to visualize the table.
I used R when building this script.
In the first task i start by finding and creating list of file directory
Then, create empty data frame for the data later
After that create a loop function for insert data from all the file into the empty data frame
Lastly then print the table 

I repeat all of the step above to print 3 tables of accounts, cards and saving account

In the second task is asked to join the table i used full join all the table 
from cards using cardsid, id, op, ts for the related collumns
from saving accounts  using saving accounts id, id, op, ts for the related collumns
