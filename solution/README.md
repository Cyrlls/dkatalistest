Here is the Script that is used to answer number 1 and number 2 task that ask to visualize the table.
I used R when building this script.
In the first task i start by finding and creating list of file directory
Then, create empty data frame for the data later
After that create a loop function for insert data from all the file into the empty data frame
Lastly then print the table 

I repeat all of the step above to print 3 tables of accounts, cards and saving account

In the second task is asked to join the table i used full join all the table 
from cards using cardsid, id, op, ts for the related collumns
from saving accounts  using saving accounts id, id, op, ts for the related collumns

In the third task is to show how many transactions has been made, when did each of them occur, and how much the value of each transaction?
In The cards <br>
1578313800000 where there is 12000 credit used in card 1 <br>
1578420000000 where there is increased credit used from 12000 to 19000 in card 1 <br>
1579361400000 where there is 37000 credit used in card 2 <br>
In the saving accounts  <br>
1577955600000 where there is increased balanced from 0 to 15000 in saving accounts  <br>
1578648600000 where there is increased balanced from 15000 to 40000 in saving accounts <br>
1578648600000 where there is decreased balanced from 40000 to 21000 in saving accounts <br>
1579505400000 where there is increased balanced from 21000 to 33000 in saving accounts <br>
